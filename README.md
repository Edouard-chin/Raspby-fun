Just a simple project to annoy my collegue at work when someone opens a pull request on github :D.

1. Clone the project
2. Download the sound utilities: sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
3. Edit this file sudo nano /etc/modules and add 'snd_bcm2835'
4. Install Mplayer sudo apt-get install mplayer
5. Edit this file sudo nano /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf and add 'nolirc=yes'

You are ready to go!
